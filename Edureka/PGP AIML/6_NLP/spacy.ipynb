    "doc = nlp('''Thank you, Phil, and hello, everyone. I’m happy to be speaking with you today. And I hope you and your loved ones continue to be safe and healthy, as we enter the holiday season and end of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first quarter, we accelerated revenue growth, reflecting the momentum from our fourth quarter strong ASV performance, and expanded our operating margin. We continue to progress in our investments in content and technology and in fact, are using a portion of the cost savings associated with the ongoing pandemic, to further fund initiatives in sales and products.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also pleased to welcome the TruValue Labs team to FactSet. Given that we closed the transaction in early November, the financial impact on our results is immaterial for this quarter. The acquisition adds approximately $5 million of ASV, which is included in our reported ASV, plus professional services.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will exclude this amount, for organic-related metrics for FY 2021. As Phil stated earlier, we grew organic ASV plus professional services at 5%, a slight de-acceleration from the previous quarter and reflecting the seasonally slower start to our fiscal year.\n",
    "\n",
    "GAAP revenue increased by, 6% to $388 million, while organic revenue which excludes any impact from foreign exchange and acquisitions, increased 5% to $387 million. Growth was driven primarily by Analytics and CTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our geographic segment Americas revenue grew 6%, EMEA came in at 5%, and Asia Pacific revenue grew 10%. The regions primarily benefited from increases in Analysts and CTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "GAAP operating expenses grew 5% in the first quarter to $267 million, impacted by, higher cost of sales. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin expanded by 30 basis points to 31% and our and our adjusted operating margin increased, by 40 basis points to 34%.\n",
    "\n",
    "These improvements are largely due to net savings, from continued productivity through workforce mix and a reduction in discretionary expenses, including lower travel and office costs. These benefits were partially offset by higher spend in both, compensation and technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 350 basis points higher than last year, on a GAAP and adjusted basis. This result reflects increased hiring from fiscal year 2020 as well as higher compensation expense for our existing employee base. Growth was also driven by higher technology spend, which includes our shift to the public cloud as part of our digital transformation and multiyear investment plan. This total was partially offset by lower third-party content costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A improved year-over-year by 380 basis points on a GAAP basis and 390 basis points on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include materially lower travel and entertainment costs, reduced spend due to office closures, and lower facility expense, offset in part by higher compensation costs. The pandemic-related savings are helping to manage a portion of our higher spend. Over the long term, we believe a portion of these savings will become permanent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 16% compared to last year’s rate of 14%, which has included income benefits related to a change in the foreign tax rate as well as credits tied to finalizing our annual tax return. GAAP EPS increased 8% to $2.62 this quarter versus $2.43 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% to $2.88. Both EPS figures were primarily driven by improved operating results. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is disclosed at the end of our press release.\n",
    "\n",
    "Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $71 million for the quarter, an increase of 3% over the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to lower CapEx on facility spend as we have finished a portion of our office build-outs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first quarter, our ASV retention continued to be above 95%. We grew the total number of clients by 6% compared to our prior year, reflecting the addition of more wealth and corporate clients, an ongoing trend in our client base. Our client retention improved to 90% year-over-year, which speaks to the mission criticality of our solutions and the efforts of our sales teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first quarter, we repurchased 133,000 shares for a total of $43 million at an average share price of $327. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. We remain measured in our outlook on growth. We also continue to monitor the factors laid out last quarter, potential delays in decision making, tightening client budget and a challenging new business environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we begin our second quarter, we have more momentum and visibility into our business, as reflected in the size and quality of our pipeline and in our level of client engagement, particularly in their digital transformation. This is an area of competitive strength for FactSet.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we invest for long-term growth in the areas of content and technology, we are redirecting savings, driven largely from the pandemic to fund additional hiring in sales and in the development of products, including in wealth and analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted earlier, we expect a portion of the T&E facilities related costs to become permanent post this pandemic environment, enabling us to offset ongoing operational expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our discipline in cost management is also reflected in our continued shift in workforce mix as well as expense rationalization with external vendors. We believe these collective actions will allow us to achieve solid results that are within our FY ‘21 guidance ranges. We are reaffirming our guidance for 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, we are now ready for questions. Kevin, back to you.\n",
